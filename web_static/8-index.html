	    Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guest house centrally located just minutes from Golden Gate Park, Grandview Park, lots of different types of restaurants and bars. It is close to many bus lines including the 28 and N and L. We have a hand made counter area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax on and have a glass of Merlot.

	    From the outside this house looks gorgeous. It has been built with sandstone and has white stone decorations. Small, half rounded windows let in plenty of light and have been added to the house in a very asymmetric way. The house is equipped with a large kitchen and one large bathroom, it also has a snug living room, five bedrooms, a small dining area and a snug storage room. The building is shaped like a short U. The two extensions are linked by a covered patio. The second floor is bigger than the first, which creates several overhanging parts on several sides of the house. This floor has roughly the same style as the floor below.
